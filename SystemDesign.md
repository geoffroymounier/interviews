### System Design Interview

We want to manage webapp of doctors

Using the design system of your choice (figma, miro)
Design a system able to 
- let a doctor create/update a profile (name, category, images,...)
- let an authenticated user retrieve a list of doctors based on criterias
- let an authenticated user retrieve the full profile of a doctor
- let a superuser (admin) edit or delete a doctor profile

You should take into account
- API endpoints
- Auth/Authorization
- Storing of data

as well as discuss stability/scalability/security/continous delivery of the system
